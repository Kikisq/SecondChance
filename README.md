# SecondChance

With the start of the new decade, more and more people are looking to organize their lives and shed things that no longer #sparkJoy.\
Inspired by the KonMari Method (who hasn't?), I found myself donating a lot, but also finding expensive things I wanted to try to sell first. Except I ended up with a screen full of tabs, trying to research a fair price to resell my items at, questioning whether the item was even worth the time and effort needed to sell it. Of course I quickly became overwhelmed and sent everything to OneTab, not accomplishing as much as I wanted.

To try to simplify the reselling process, I'm creating a Chrome Extension to look up UPCs/item names on multiple platforms with dedicated secondhand programs (e.g. GameStop, Amazon, Poshmark).

The User clicks on the Second Chance icon and toggles which sites to search for the item on.\
If the User is looking to sell a video game, sites like GameStop, Best Buy, and Amazon should be toggled on, while Poshmark should be toggled off.\
Second Chance opens the toggled sites in new tabs, showing how much the item can be traded in or sold for, enabling the User to gain a better understanding of the item's resale value.
